Abstract = {{In this work, we explore the interplay between manganese oxide (MnOx)
   nanomaterials and a glassy carbon (GC) support in catalyzing the oxygen
   reduction reaction (ORR) in an alkaline environment. Initially, we
   characterize the ORR activity of bare GC electrodes as a function of
   heat treatments in air, and find that ORR activity increases with
   increasing temperature up to 500 degrees C. Modification of GC with
   size-selected 1 nm MnOx nanoparticles prior to the 500 degrees C heat
   treatment yields a highly porous GC (pGC) structure, devoid of MnOx.
   This pGC sample exhibits the highest ORR performance of the bare carbon
   electrodes reaching an onset potential of 0.75 V vs the reversible
   hydrogen electrode (RHE) and a complete 2-electron reduction of oxygen
   to peroxide. Having established ORR activity of bare GC electrodes, we
   deposit size-selected 14 nm MnO nanoparticles onto the GC and pGC
   electrodes and then incite phase changes in MnO through heat treatments
   in air. Electrochemical characterization of the resulting electrodes
   reveals that MnO nanoparticles offer no improvement in the ORR onset
   potential over bare GC or pGC and only slightly increase the number of
   electrons transferred. By contrast, thermal oxidation of MnO
   nanoparticles to Mn3O4 at 500 degrees C, confirmed by Mn L-edge X-ray
   absorption spectroscopy, results in an improved ORR onset potential of
   0.80 V and a 4-electron reduction of oxygen. Thus at low overpotentials,
   where GC and pGC were inactive for the ORR, MnOx sites must contribute
   to all steps of the reaction. The catalyst's estimated specific activity
   of 3700 mu A.cm(cat)(-2), at 0.75 V compares favorably with specific
   activities of Pt/C as well as the best nonprecious metal catalysts. This
   establishes Mn3O4 as another MnOx phase with high activity for the ORR.}},

Abstract = {{Grain boundaries (GBs) in Cu(In, Ga)Se-2 (CIGS) and CdTe thin film solar
   cells are known to be beneficial for achieving high conversion
   efficiencies. In this work, we will show that Cu2ZnSnS4 (CZTS) and
   Cu2ZnSn(S, Se)(4) (CZTSSe) solar cells have the same GB electronic
   properties as CIGS and CdTe. Scanning Kelvin Probe Microscopy (SKPM)
   measurements reveal a higher positive surface potential at the GBs as
   compared to the grain while Conductive Atomic Force Microscopy (C-AFM)
   measurements show higher current flow in the vicinity of the GBs. These
   two measurement results are similar to those obtained for CIGS and CdTe
   and together they demonstrate the enhanced minority carrier collection
   taking place at the GBs of CZTS and CZTSSe. This implies that CZTS and
   CZTSSe solar cells have the potential to achieve the high efficiencies
   that CIGS and CdTe solar cells enjoy.}},

Abstract = {{We grow biaxially textured heteroepitaxial crystal silicon (c-Si) films
   on display glass as a low-cost photovoltaic material. We first fabricate
   textured CaF2 seed layers using ion-beam assisted deposition, then coat
   the CaF2 with a thin, evaporated epitaxial Ge buffer and finally deposit
   heteroepitaxial silicon on the Ge. The silicon is grown by hot-wire
   chemical vapor deposition, a high-rate, scalable epitaxy technology.
   Electron and X-ray diffraction confirm the biaxial texture of the CaF2
   and epitaxial growth of the subsequent layers. Transmission electron
   microscopy reveals columnar silicon grains about 500 nm across. We
   fabricate a proof-of-concept epitaxial film c-Si solar cell with an open
   circuit voltage of 375 mV that is limited by minority carrier lifetime.}},

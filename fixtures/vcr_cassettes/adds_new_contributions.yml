        an orthopedic perspective.</Title>\r\n    <Abstract>Frostbite injury to the
        extremities has the potential for disastrous effects. This review provides
        information valuable to the orthopedic surgeon to aid in the evaluation and
        treatment of frostbite. The pathophysiology and predisposing factors that
        provide a basic understanding of the nature of frostbite are discussed. Accepted
        and experimental imaging studies and treatment options are also reviewed.
        An effort is made to give the orthopedic perspective on each issue, providing
        a valuable resource for all orthopedic surgeons involved in the care of the
        patient with frostbite.</Abstract>\r\n    <AuthorList>McAdams,T,R|Swenson,D,R|MILLER,R,A</AuthorList>\r\n

        \   <Title>TRACHEAL DAMAGE FOLLOWING CONVENTIONAL AND HIGH-FREQUENCY VENTILATION
        AT LOW AND HIGH HUMIDITY</Title>\r\n    <Abstract>Objectives: To compare the
        degree of tracheobronchial damage in newborn lambs ventilated for 6 hrs with
        relative humidities of 30% or 90% and continuous positive airway pressure
        breathing, conventional mechanical ventilation of 25 and 60 breaths/min, or
        high frequency flow-interrupted ventilation at 600 breaths/min.  Background
        and Methods: Tracheobronchial damage secondary to mechanical ventilation remains
        a major iatrogenic lesion of the newborn despite substantial advances in both
        mechanical design and ventilatory techniques. A histologic scoring system
        was used to compare the damage noted in the tracheobronchial epithelium of
        newborn lambs after 6 hrs of conventional mechanical ventilation or high-frequency
        flow-interrupted ventilation at two relative humidities. Three groups of animals
        were ventilated for 6 hrs with an F(IO2) of 0.21 at 36.0-degrees-C and relative
        humidity of 90%. The first group received continuous positive airway pressure
        of 4 cm H2O, the second group received slow rate, conventional mechanical
        ventilation at 25 breaths/min, and the third group received fast rate, conventional
        mechanical ventilation at 60 breaths/min. Two other groups of animals were
        ventilated for 6 hrs with an F(IO2) of 0.21 at 36.0-degrees-C and relative
        humidity of 30%. The first group was ventilated with high-frequency flow-interrupted
        ventilation at 600 breaths/min and the second group with slow rate, conventional
        mechanical ventilation at 25 breaths/min. Two additional groups served as
        nonintubated controls; one group was killed immediately after sedation and
        the other group was killed after 6 hrs of sedation.  Results: The damage was
        mild but significantly different from controls when 90% humidity was used
        and there was no difference in the histology score between continuous positive
        airway pressure breathing and conventional mechanical ventilation at 25 or
        60 breaths/min. Significant inflammation, erosion, necrosis, and blistering
        occurred with both conventional mechanical ventilation at 25 breaths/min and
        high-frequency flow-interrupted ventilation at 600 breaths/min when 30% humidity
        was used. The damage was only found 5 mm below the tip of the endotracheal
        tube and not at 3.5 cm beyond the endotracheal tube in the trachea nor in
        the right main bronchus. Conclusion: These data indicate that endotracheal
        intubation and mechanical ventilation, regardless of the method of ventilation,
        cause damage to the tracheal mucosa, but that poorly humidified inspired gases
        cause significantly greater damage.</Abstract>\r\n    <AuthorList>Todd,D,A|John,E,|OSBORN,R,A</AuthorList>\r\n

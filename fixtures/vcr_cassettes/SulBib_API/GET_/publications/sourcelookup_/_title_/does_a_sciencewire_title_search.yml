        of elemene injection combined radiotherapy in lung cancer treatment among
        patients with brain metastases: A systematic review and meta-analysis.</Title>\r\n
        \   <Abstract>BACKGROUND This review evaluates the effectiveness and safety
        of elemene injection combined radiotherapy in the treatment of lung cancer
        with brain metastases.\r\nMETHODS A systematic literature research was conducted
        from EMBASE, Cochrane Library, PubMed, Chinese biomedical database, Chinese
        scientific journal database, China knowledge resource integrated database,
        and WanFang Database from established to July 2016 without language restriction.
        The Cochrane Collaboration tool was used to evaluate the risk of bias. All
        statistical analyses were conducted with STATA (version 14.0) and RevMan (version
        5.3).\r\nRESULTS Eleven randomized controlled trials (765 patients) were included
        for determining the effectiveness and safety of elemene combined with radiotherapy
        in the treatment of lung cancer with brain metastases. Objective response
        rate (ORR) [odds ratio (OR)?=?2.89, 95% confidence interval (95% CI) 2.04-4.08,
        P?&lt;?.00001] and symptoms (OR?=?4.06, 95% CI 2.00-8.25, P?=?.0001) improved
        more in the elemene-based combination treatment group than in the radiotherapy-alone
        control group. The Karnofsky Performance Status (KPS) score was used to measure
        patients' improvement rate. The patients who were treated with elemene-based
        combination with radiotherapy were higher than those patients who were treated
        with radiotherapy alone (OR?=?3.51, 95% CI 2.20-5.61, P?&lt;?.00001]. The
        incidence of bone marrow suppression (OR?=?0.27, 95% CI 0.11-0.68, P?=?.006)
        and leukopenia (OR?=?0.23, 95% CI 0.12-0.46, P?&lt;?.00001) decreased in the
        elemene-based combination treatment group by radiotherapy significantly.\r\nCONCLUSIONS
        The elemene injection combined radiotherapy in the treatment of lung cancer
        with brain metastases appears to improve the treatment response rate and alleviated
        symptoms. The combined treatment has showed positive impact to reduce adverse
        reactions and improve quality of life.</Abstract>\r\n    <AuthorList>Jiang,Xutao,|Hidru,Tesfaldet,Habtemariam|Zhang,Zhuo,|Bai,Yu,|Kong,Lingchao,|Li,Xiaofeng,</AuthorList>\r\n

        \   <Title>A novel EGFR-TKI inhibitor (cAMP-H3BO3 complex) combined with thermal
        therapy is a promising strategy to improve lung cancer treatment outcomes.</Title>\r\n
        \   <Abstract>PURPOSE Although EGFR-TKIs (epidermal growth factor receptor
        tyrosine kinase inhibitors) induce favorable responses as first-line non-small
        cell lung cancer treatments, drug resistance remains a serious problem. Meanwhile,
        thermal therapy also shows promise as a cancer therapy strategy. Here we combine
        a novel EGFR-TKI treatment with thermal therapy to improve lung cancer treatment
        outcomes.\r\nRESULTS The results suggest that the cAMP-H3BO3 complex effectively
        inhibits EGFR auto-phosphorylation, while inducing apoptosis and cell cycle
        arrest in vitro. Compared to the negative control, tumor growth was significantly
        suppressed in mice treated with oxidative phosphorylation uncoupler thyroxine
        sodium and either cAMP-H3BO3 complex or cAMP-H3BO3 complex (P &lt; 0.05).
        Moreover, the body temperature increase induced by treatment with thyroxine
        sodium inhibited tumor growth. Immunohistochemical analyses showed that A549
        cell apoptosis was significantly higher in the cAMP-H3BO3 complex plus thyroxine
        sodium treatment group than in the other groups. Moreover,Ca2+ content analysis
        showed that the Ca2+ content of tumor tissue was significantly higher in the
        cAMP-H3BO3 complex plus thyroxine sodium treatment group than in other groups.\r\nMATERIALS
        AND METHODS Inhibition of EGFR auto-phosphorylation by cAMP and cAMP-H3BO3
        complex was studied using autoradiography and western blot. The antitumor
        activity of the novel EGFR inhibitor (cAMP-H3BO3 complex) with or without
        an oxidative phosphorylation uncoupler (thyroxine sodium) was investigated
        in vitro and in a nude mouse xenograft lung cancer model incorporating human
        A549 cells.\r\nCONCLUSIONS cAMP-H3BO3 complex is a novel EGFR-TKI. Combination
        therapy using cAMP-H3BO3 with thyroxine sodium-induced thermal therapy may
        improve lung cancer treatment outcomes.</Abstract>\r\n    <AuthorList>Tong,Yongpeng,|Huang,Chunliu,|Zhang,Junfang,</AuthorList>\r\n

        \   <Title>Physician variation in lung cancer treatment at the end of life.</Title>\r\n
        \   <Abstract>OBJECTIVES To determine whether a treating oncologist's characteristics
        are associated with variation in use of chemotherapy for patients with advanced
        non-small cell lung cancer (aNSCLC) at the end of life.\r\nSTUDY DESIGN Retrospective
        cohort.\r\nMETHODS Using the 2009 Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results-Medicare
        database, we studied chemotherapy receipt within 30 days of death among Medicare
        enrollees who were diagnosed with aNSCLC between 1999 and 2006, received chemotherapy,
        and died within 3 years of diagnosis. A multilevel model was constructed to
        assess the contribution of patient and physician characteristics and geography
        to receiving chemotherapy within 30 days of death.\r\nRESULTS Among 21,894
        patients meeting eligibility criteria, 43.1% received chemotherapy within
        30 days of death. In unadjusted bivariate analyses, female sex, Asian or black
        race, older age, and a greater number of comorbid diagnoses predicted lower
        likelihood of receiving chemotherapy at the end of life (P =.038 for all comparisons).
        Adjusting for patient and physician characteristics, physicians in small independent
        practices were substantially more likely than those employed in other practice
        models, particularly academic practices or nongovernment hospitals, to order
        chemotherapy for a patient in the last 30 days of life (P &lt;.001 for all
        comparisons); female physicians were less likely than males to prescribe such
        treatment (P = .04).\r\nCONCLUSIONS Patients receiving care for aNSCLC in
        small independent oncology practices are more likely to receive chemotherapy
        in the last 30 days of life.</Abstract>\r\n    <AuthorList>Green,Jonas,B|Shapiro,Martin,F|Ettner,Susan,L|Malin,Jennifer,|Ang,Alfonso,|Wong,Mitchell,D</AuthorList>\r\n

        \   <Title>Video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery node dissection for lung cancer
        treatment.</Title>\r\n    <Abstract>PURPOSE Mediastinal node dissection (MND)
        is an integral component of the surgical treatment for non-small cell lung
        cancer (NSCLC). Although video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) has been
        used increasingly for lung cancer treatment, the accuracy of by VATS MND still
        remains controversial. We reviewed the surgical results of VATS MND for NSCLC.\r\nMETHODS
        A systematic review of literature was performed, and articles that fully described
        the surgical procedure, devices, and results of VATS MND were selected to
        compare the efficacy of MND by VATS and thoracotomy.\r\nRESULTS Various techniques
        and equipments have been shown to perform adequate MND, but there is an argument
        as to the method of estimation of the accuracy of MND. Most of the recent
        studies showed that the nodal upstaging and number of dissected nodes are
        significantly lower by VATS than after thoracotomy. Oppositely, some studies
        showed VATS noninferiority in these issues. Complications such as chylothorax,
        pleural effusion, bleeding, and nerve damage were similar in both groups.\r\nCONCLUSIONS
        Although ND by VATS remains controversial, VATS MND is becoming easier and
        more feasible owing to the development of more advanced endoscopic cameras
        and equipments. We should learn further to become more adept at performing
        adequate ND by VATS.</Abstract>\r\n    <AuthorList>Watanabe,Atsushi,|Miyajima,Masahiro,|Mishina,Taijiro,|Tsuruta,Kodai,|Takahashi,Yuki,|Maki,Ryunosuke,|Tada,Makoto,</AuthorList>\r\n

        \   <Title>Antineoplastic Treatment of Advanced-Stage Non-Small-Cell Lung
        Cancer: Treatment, Survival, and Spending (2000 to 2011)</Title>\r\n    <Abstract>Purpose
        \ Multiple agents for advanced non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) have been
        approved in the past decade, but little is known about their use and associated
        spending and survival.  Methods  We used SEER-Medicare data for elderly patients
        with a new diagnosis of advanced-stage NSCLC and were treated with antineoplastic
        agents between 2000 and 2011 (N = 22,163). We estimated the adjusted percentage
        of patients who received each agent, days while on treatment, survival, and
        spending in the 12 months after diagnosis.  Results  During the 12-year study
        period, a marked shift in treatment occurred along with a rapid adoption of
        pemetrexed (39.2%), erlotinib (20.3%), and bevacizumab (18.9%) and a decline
        in paclitaxel (38.7%), gemcitabine (17.0%), and vinorelbine (5.7%; all P &lt;
        .05). The average total days on therapy increased by 5 days (from 103 to 108
        days). Patients who received bevacizumab, erlotinib, or pemetrexed had the
        longest treatment durations on average (approximately 146 days v 75 days for
        those who did not receive these agents). Approximately 44% of patients received
        antineoplastic agents in the last 30 days of life throughout the study period.
        Acute inpatient spending declined (from $29,376 to $23,731), whereas outpatient
        spending increased 23% (from $37,931 to $46,642). Median survival gains of
        1.5 months were observed.  Conclusion  Considerable shifts in the treatment
        of advanced-stage NSCLC occurred along with modest gains in survival and total
        Medicare spending. More precise outcome information is needed to inform value-based
        treatment decisions for advanced-stage NSCLC. (C) 2017 by American Society

        Metabolite of Ticagrelor Disturbs the Metabolic Elimination of Lung Cancer
        Treatment Drug Irinotecan</Title>\r\n    <Abstract>Irinotecan is the first-line
        anti-lung cancer drug, and irinotecan undergoes two-step metabolic reaction
        to form the glucuronide of SN-38 after administration of irinotecan. Ticagrelor
        is a platelet aggregation inhibitor produced by AstraZeneca, and approximately
        1/3 of ticagrelor is metabolized to form its active metabolite AR-C124910.
        Irinotecan-ticagrelor interaction was evaluated through determining the inhibition
        of AR-C124910 on the glucuronidation of SN-38 using in vitro human liver microsomes
        (HLMs) incubation system. Initial screening of the inhibition of AR-C124910
        on the glucuronidation of SN-38 showed that 100 mu M of AR-C124910 significantly
        inhibited the glucuronidation metabolism of SN-38 (p &lt; 0.01). Furthermore,
        concentration-dependent inhibition of AR-C124910 on the glucuronidation of
        SN-38 was demonstrated, and the IC50 value was calculated to be 12.5 mu M.
        Lineweaver-Burk plot showed that AR-C124910 competitively inhibited SN-38
        glucuronidation. Using the second plot, the inhibition kinetic parameter (Ki)
        was calculated to be 32.7 mu M. In conclusion, ticagrelor is firstly metabolized
        to form its active metabolite AR-C124910, and AR-C124910 strongly inhibited
        the glucuronidation of SN-38. Therefore, potential ticagrelor-irinotecan interaction
        was demonstrated in this study through evaluating the inhibition of AR-C124910
        on the glucuronidation of SN-38.</Abstract>\r\n    <AuthorList>Zhang,Jing,|Yang,Yang,</AuthorList>\r\n

        \   <Title>MM-151 Oligoclonal anti-EGFR antibody combination Treatment of
        colorectal cancer Treatment of non-small cell lung cancer Treatment of head
        and neck cancer</Title>\r\n    <Abstract>MM-151 is a third-generation epidermal
        growth factor receptor (EGFR) inhibitor comprising an oligoclonal combination
        of three fully human IgG1 antibodies that target distinct nonoverlapping EGFR
        epitopes to inhibit binding of all EGFR ligands at subnanomolar affinity.
        There is a significant redundancy in the ERB receptor tyrosine kinase signaling
        pathways, which are a well-established target for anticancer therapies. Such
        redundancy, in addition to receptor mutation in pretreated patients, is a
        significant problem for drug-resistant tumors, particularly in patients with
        metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC). Preclinical studies have shown that MM-151
        uniquely downregulates the EGFR, inhibits binding of all low-and high-affinity
        ligands to the receptor, and activates immune effector responses. In addition,
        MM-151 has a binding profile that is not affected by acquired EGFR mutations.
        Preliminary clinical studies have indicated that MM-151 monotherapy or MM-151
        plus irinotecan was well tolerated and showed promising efficacy in patients
        with mCRC.</Abstract>\r\n    <AuthorList>Haddley,K,</AuthorList>\r\n    <AuthorCount>1</AuthorCount>\r\n

        \   <Title>MicroRNA-Related Polymorphisms in PI3K/Akt/mTOR Pathway Genes Are
        Predictive of Limited-Disease Small Cell Lung Cancer Treatment Outcomes</Title>\r\n
        \   <Abstract>The phosphoinositide-3 kinase (PI3K)/Akt/mammalian target of
        rapamycin (mTOR) signaling pathway plays an important role in cancer progression
        and treatment, including that of small cell lung cancer (SCLC), a disease
        with traditionally poor prognosis. Given the regulatory role of microRNA (miRNA)
        in gene expression, we examined the association of single nucleotide polymorphisms
        (SNPs) at miRNA-binding sites of genes in the mTOR pathway with the prognosis
        of patients with limited-disease SCLC. A retrospective study was conducted
        of 146 patients with limited-disease SCLC treated with chemoradiotherapy.
        Nine SNPs of six mTOR pathway genes were genotyped using blood samples. Cox
        proportional hazard regression modeling and recursive partitioning analysis
        were performed to identify SNPs significantly associated with overall survival.
        Three SNPs, MTOR: rs2536 (T&gt;C), PIK3R1: rs3756668 (A&gt;G), and PIK3R1:
        rs12755 (A&gt;C), were associated with longer overall survival. Recursive
        partitioning analysis based on unfavorable genotype combinations of the rs2536
        and rs3756668 SNPs classified patients into three risk subgroups and was internally
        validated with 1000 bootstrap samples. These findings suggest that miRNA-related
        polymorphisms in the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway may be valuable biomarkers to complement
        clinicopathological variables in predicting prognosis of limited-disease SCLC
        and to facilitate selection of patients likely to benefit from chemoradiotherapy.</Abstract>\r\n

        \   <Title>Polymeric Nanoparticle-Mediated Gene Delivery for Lung Cancer Treatment</Title>\r\n
        \   <Abstract>In recent years, researchers have focused on targeted gene therapy
        for lung cancer, using nanoparticle carriers to overcome the limitations of
        conventional treatment methods. The main goal of targeted gene therapy is
        to develop more efficient therapeutic strategies by improving the bioavailability,
        stability, and target specificity of gene therapeutics and to reduce off-target
        effects. Polymer-based nanoparticles, an alternative to lipid and inorganic
        nanoparticles, efficiently carry nucleic acid therapeutics and are stable
        in vivo. Receptor-targeted delivery is a promising approach that can limit
        non-specific gene delivery and can be achieved by modifying the polymer nanoparticle
        surface with specific receptor ligands or antibodies. This review highlights
        the recent developments in gene delivery using synthetic and natural polymer-based
        nucleic acid carriers for lung cancer treatment. Various nanoparticle systems
        based on polymers and polymer combinations are discussed. Further, examples
        of targeting ligands or moieties used in targeted, polymer-based gene delivery
        to lung cancer are reviewed.</Abstract>\r\n    <AuthorList>Amreddy,Narsireddy,|Babu,Anish,|Muralidharan,Ranganayaki,|Munshi,Anupama,|Ramesh,Rajagopal,</AuthorList>\r\n

        \   <Title>Clinic application of tissue engineered bronchus for lung cancer
        treatment</Title>\r\n    <Abstract>Background: Delayed revascularization process
        and substitute infection remain to be key challenges in tissue engineered
        (TE) airway reconstruction. We propose an \"in-vivo bioreactor\" design, defined
        as an implanted TE substitutes perfused with an intra-scaffold medium flow
        created by an extracorporeal portable pump system for in situ organ regeneration.
        The perfusate keeps pre-seeded cells alive before revascularization. Meanwhile
        the antibiotic inside the perfusate controls topical infection.  Methods:
        A stage IIIA squamous lung cancer patient received a 5-cm TE airway substitute,
        bridging left basal segment bronchus to carina, with the in-vivo bioreactor
        design to avoid left pneumonectomy. Continuous intra-scaffold Ringer's-gentamicin
        perfusion lasted for 1 month, together with orthotopic peripheral total nucleated
        cells (TNCs) injection twice a week.  Results: The patient recovered uneventfully.
        Bronchoscopy follow-up confirmed complete revascularization and reepithelialization
        four months postoperatively. Perfusate waste test demonstrated various revascularization
        growth factors secreted by TNCs. The patient received two cycles of chemotherapy
        and 30 Gy radiotherapy thereafter without complications related to the TE
        substitute.  Conclusions: In-vivo bioreactor design combines the traditionally
        separated in vitro 3D cell-scaffold culture system and the in vivo regenerative
        processes associated with TE substitutes, while treating the recipients as
        bioreactors for their own TE prostheses. This design can be applied clinically.
        We also proved for the first time that TE airway substitute is able to tolerate
        chemo-radiotherapy and suitable to be used in cancer treatment.</Abstract>\r\n

        \   <Title>Impact of race on early-stage lung cancer treatment and survival.</Title>\r\n
        \   <Abstract>232 Background: Studies have documented racial differences along
        the lung cancer continuum and equity in care is essential to quality improvement.
        The purpose of this study was to investigate the influence of race on lung
        cancer treatment and survival among early-stage non-small cell lung cancer
        patients in an equal access healthcare system. We hypothesize that patients
        receiving similar treatment will have similar survival.\r\nMETHODS Data were
        from the External Peer Review Program (EPRP) Lung Cancer Special Study, which
        was a cross-sectional study conducted to assess the quality of care among
        patients diagnosed with lung cancer and receiving care at a VA facility. All
        patients were diagnosed between October 1, 2006 and December 31, 2007. Analyses
        were restricted to patients with Stage I/II NSCLC (n=1,426; 1,229 whites,
        197 blacks). Multivariate logistic regression was used to estimate odds ratios
        (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (95%CI).\r\nRESULTS The proportion of blacks
        who had surgery was significantly less than that among whites (OR: 0.56, 95%
        CI 0.39-0.79). There was no racial difference in receipt of adjuvant therapy
        (chemotherapy and/or radiation therapy) among patients who had surgery (p=0.08).
        Among patients who did not undergo surgery, blacks were more likely to refuse
        surgery (OR: 2.30, 95% CI 1.29-4.13); however, the proportion of patients
        with contraindications to surgery and those receiving palliative treatment
        were similar in both race groups. The 2-year survival rate was 69% and race
        was not a predictor of survival when controlling for receipt of surgery along
        with other covariates (p=0.76). The 2-year survival rate was 82% among patients
        who had surgery, and 48% among patients who did not have surgery. Specifically
        among patients who did not have surgery due to refusal, the survival rate
        was 55%.\r\nCONCLUSIONS We observed a racial disparity in surgery, partially
        due to the greater rate of refusal among blacks, but not adjuvant or palliative
        treatment. Race did not have a major impact on 2-year survival for patients
        with early-stage lung cancer. These findings stress the need to better understand
        patient preferences regarding surgery and identify ways to reduce this variation
        in surgery to improve quality of lung cancer care.</Abstract>\r\n    <AuthorList>Provenzale,Dawn,T|Stechuchak,Karen,M|Kelley,Michael,J</AuthorList>\r\n

        \   <Title>Analysis of the impact of lung cancer treatment on nontuberculous
        mycobacterial lung diseases.</Title>\r\n    <Abstract>BACKGROUND Although
        nontuberculous mycobacteria (NTM) lung diseases can occur in association with
        lung cancer, no study has evaluated the effect of lung cancer treatment on
        NTM lung diseases. Therefore, the present study aimed to retrospectively examine
        the effect of lung cancer treatment on NTM lung diseases.\r\nMETHODS Patients
        diagnosed with NTM lung diseases in combination with cytologically or histologically
        proven lung cancer between January 1, 2010 and October 31, 2014 were enroled.
        The clinical history of eligible patients was retrospectively reviewed.\r\nRESULTS
        Seven hundred twenty-eight patients were diagnosed with NTM lung diseases.
        Among these patients, 29 (3.9%) also had lung cancer. Of the 29 patients with
        NTM and lung cancer, 62% had Mycobacterium avium complex as the pathogenic
        organism. The most common lung cancer histology was adenocarcinoma (62.1%).
        Anti-cancer cytotoxic chemotherapy was administered to seven patients, and
        the two patients who did not receive NTM treatment showed worsening of their
        NTM lung disease.\r\nCONCLUSION Whether NTM lung disease should be treated
        during anti-cancer chemotherapy has not been not clarified by this study.
        Induction of anti-NTM therapy should be made after careful consideration,
        because the duration of anti-NTM treatment is long and anti-mycobacterial
        drugs have extensive effects on anti-cancer drugs. However, we think that
        anti-NTM therapy should be introduced after consideration of the worsening
        of symptoms and radiological findings associated with NTM lung disease.</Abstract>\r\n

        \   <Title>Predisposing factors of blood brain barrier penetration from docetaxel
        during lung cancer treatment: Preliminary study.</Title>\r\n    <Abstract>17102
        Background: Patients with lung cancer account for approximately 50% of brain
        metastasis cases. On the other hand the majority of active cytotoxic agents
        (like taxanes) in lung cancer treatment, are unable to penetrate blood brain
        barrier (BBB) so the role of chemotherapy in management of brain metastasis
        from lung cancer remain controversial. To investigate predisposing factors
        (if any) of penetration of BBB from cytotoxic agents we measured concentation
        levels of Docetaxel in serum and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) during first line
        chemotherapy.\r\nMETHODS Twelve lung cancer patients receiving chemotherapy
        consisted of Docetaxel (100 mg/m\r\nMETHODS ) and Carboplatin AUC 6 were included
        in this study. CSF and plasma samples were withdrawn half an hour after termination
        of chemotherapy infusion. Measurements were performed with high performance
        liquid chromatography and UV detection was at 227 nm.\r\nRESULTS Mean levels
        of docetaxel in blood was 2,5530 ± 0,53 mg/l and in CSF 0,7397 ± 0,22 mg/l.
        Three out of twelve patient had SCLC (2 with ED and 1 with LD) and 9 with
        NSCLC (2 stage IIIB and 7 stage IV). In three patients without metastasis
        no detectible level of docetaxel was measured. We were also unable to detect
        Docetaxel in CSF of the patient with NSCLC and metastasis in the ipsilateral
        lung. On the other hand in 9 patients with metastatic disease (4 brain metastasis
        2 with bone metastasis 1 with metastasis in liver and adrenal and 2 with liver
        and bone metastasis) had detectable levels of docetaxel in CSF. There was
        not statistically significant correlation of docetaxel in plasma and CSF.
        Only one patient without any evidence of metastasis had a detectable level
        of Docetaxel in CSF (0,33229) but in 6 weeks a brain metastasis was apparent
        in brain MRI.\r\nCONCLUSIONS Metastasis development seems to be associated
        with a modification of BBB penetration. If Docetaxel penetrates BBB (especially
        in the presence of brain metastasis) it would be probable to accelerate radiotherapy
        sensitivity of brain metastasis. No significant financial relationships to

        \   <Title>Impact of dose calculation models on radiotherapy outcomes and
        quality adjusted life years for lung cancer treatment: do we need to measure
        radiotherapy outcomes to tune the radiobiological parameters of a normal tissue
        complication probability model?</Title>\r\n    <Abstract>BACKGROUND The equivalent
        uniform dose (EUD) radiobiological model can be applied for lung cancer treatment
        plans to estimate the tumor control probability (TCP) and the normal tissue
        complication probability (NTCP) using different dose calculation models. Then,
        based on the different calculated doses, the quality adjusted life years (QALY)
        score can be assessed versus the uncomplicated tumor control probability (UTCP)
        concept in order to predict the overall outcome of the different treatment
        plans.\r\nMETHODS Nine lung cancer cases were included in this study. For
        the each patient, two treatments plans were generated. The doses were calculated
        respectively from pencil beam model, as pencil beam convolution (PBC) turning
        on 1D density correction with Modified Batho's (MB) method, and point kernel
        model as anisotropic analytical algorithm (AAA) using exactly the same prescribed
        dose, normalized to 100% at isocentre point inside the target and beam arrangements.
        The radiotherapy outcomes and QALY were compared. The bootstrap method was
        used to improve the 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) estimation. Wilcoxon
        paired test was used to calculate P value.\r\nRESULTS Compared to AAA considered
        as more realistic, the PBC\r\nRESULTS  overestimated the TCP while underestimating
        NTCP, P&lt;0.05. Thus the UTCP and the QALY score were also overestimated.\r\nCONCLUSIONS
        To correlate measured QALY's obtained from the follow-up of the patients with
        calculated QALY from DVH metrics, the more accurate dose calculation models
        should be first integrated in clinical use. Second, clinically measured outcomes
        are necessary to tune the parameters of the NTCP model used to link the treatment
        outcome with the QALY. Only after these two steps, the comparison and the
        ranking of different radiotherapy plans would be possible, avoiding over/under
        estimation of QALY and any other clinic-biological estimates.</Abstract>\r\n

        \   <Title>My Cancer Genome: Web-based clinical decision support for genome-directed
        lung cancer treatment.</Title>\r\n    <Abstract>7576 Background: Lung cancer
        has traditionally been treated according to histologic subtype with a plateau
        in the efficacy of combination chemotherapy. Recent advances have identified
        oncogenic 'driver mutations' in lung cancer that predict response to targeted
        therapies. However, knowledge resources are limited regarding the clinical
        relevance of such mutations.\r\nMETHODS We performed a literature review regarding
        the prevalence and clinical significance of various treatments for ~40 mutations
        in 10 genes (EGFR, KRAS, BRAF, NRAS, PIK3CA, MEK1, AKT1, HER2, PTEN, and ALK)
        for non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Data from prospective and retrospective
        trials as well as preclinical studies was collected.\r\nRESULTS ~100 articles/abstracts
        were synthesized into the publicly available My Cancer Genome website (mycancergenome.org)
        which launched in Jan 2011. Content includes information about the oncogene
        pathway (e.g. What is EGFR?), the clinical significance of the gene for a
        specific type of cancer (e.g. EGFR in NSCLC), and a summary of clinically
        relevant data related to a particular gene mutation (e.g. EGFR Exon 19 deletion
        in NSCLC). Information regarding mutation directed clinical trials open for
        accrual both at Vanderbilt Ingram Cancer Center and worldwide is provided
        using a direct query of clinicaltrials.gov. This decision support tool is
        integrated into Vanderbilt's electronic medical record to provide actionable
        decision support for mutation directed treatment prioritization and clinical
        trial availability. Clinicians, patients, and researchers with access to the
        internet can also access the website freely and directly.\r\nCONCLUSIONS My
        Cancer Genome is an international resource to assist clinicians in prioritizing
        genome directed cancer therapies. The first implementation includes content
        for NSCLC. We are now expanding the content to include melanoma, breast cancer,
        colon cancer and other malignancies. New data will be incorporated on an ongoing
        basis. We welcome public/private partnerships to expand content and make this
        a truly global resource.</Abstract>\r\n    <AuthorList>Levy,M,A|Lovly,C,M|Horn,L,|Naser,R,|Pao,W,</AuthorList>\r\n

        \   <Title>SU-E-J-06: A Feasibility Study On Clinical Implementation of 4D-CBCT
        in Lung Cancer Treatment.</Title>\r\n    <Abstract>PURPOSE Four-dimensional
        cone-beam CT (4D-CBCT) is a novel imaging technique to setup patients with
        pulmonary lesions in radiation therapy. This paper is to perform a feasibility
        study on the implementation of 4D-CBCT as image guidance for (1) SBRT and
        (2) Low Modulation (Low-Mod) IMRT in lung cancer treatment.\r\nMETHODS Image
        artifacts and observers variability are evaluated by analyzing the 4D-CT QA
        phantom and patient 4D image data. There are two 4D-CBCT image artifacts:
        (1) Spatial artifact caused by the patient irregular breathing pattern will
        generate blurring and anatomy gap/overlap; (2) Cone beam scattering and hardening
        artifact will affect the image spatial and contrast resolution. The couch
        shift varies between 1mm to 3mm from different observers during the 4D-CBCT
        registration. Breath training is highly recommended to improve the respiratory
        regularity during CT simulation and treatment, especially for SBRT. Elekta
        XVI 4.5 Symmetry protocol is adopted in the patient 4DCBCT scanning and intensity-based
        registration. Physician adjustments on the auto-registration are involved
        prior to the treatment. Physician peer review on 4D-CBCT image acquisition
        and registration is also recommended to reduce the inter-observer variability.
        The average 4D-CT in reference volume coordinates is exported to MIM Vista
        5.6.2 to manually fuse to the planning CT for further evaluation.\r\nRESULTS
        (1) SBRT: 4DCBCT is performed in dry-run and in each treatment fraction. Image
        registration and couch shift are reviewed by another physician on the 1st
        fraction before the treatment starts. (2) Low-Mod IMRT: 4D-CBCT is performed
        and peer reviewed on weekly basis.\r\nCONCLUSION 4D-CBCT in SBRT dry-run can
        discover the ITV discrepancies caused by the low quality 4D-CT simulation.
        4D-CBCT during SBRT and Low-Mod IMRT treatment provides physicians more confidence
        to target lung tumor and capability to evaluate inter-fractional ITV changes.
        More advanced 4D-CBCT scan protocol and reconstruction algorithm may be needed
        in the future.</Abstract>\r\n    <AuthorList>Hu,Y,|Ruan,C,|Stanford,J,|Duggar,W,|Rajaguru,P,|He,R,|Yang,C,</AuthorList>\r\n

        \   <Title>Multicentric descriptive study of the lung cancer treatment.</Title>\r\n
        \   <Abstract>20109 Background: Given the insufficient available information
        on the clinical characteristics and the results of the lung cancer treatment
        at a population level, we performed a large multicentric descriptive study
        in the main hospitals in our city.\r\nMETHODS We analyzed the patients diagnosed
        and treated for lung cancer during 1999 in five University Hospitals in Barcelona
        (Spain). We performed a retrospective analysis of the individual data obtained
        from the clinical records using a specifically validated questionnaire. A
        descriptive analysis was performed, stratifying for type of tumor, stage,
        and institution. The follow-up for the complete population was 5 years.\r\nRESULTS
        We included 836 patients (94.6% male, 5.4% female) with an average age of
        64 years. Karnofsky was = 70% in 85% of patients. Histologic distribution
        was non-small cell (NSCLC) 85.5%, small-cell (SCLC) 14.5%. 42% of cases were
        stage IV (38% NSCLC, 67.8% SCLC). First treatment was performed in 82% of
        cases with therapeutic intention (52% was chemotherapy). Pulmonary resection
        with lobectomy and platinum-based chemotherapy were the more frequent treatments.
        Complete remission was obtained in 25% of cases. Survival was 42.0, 17.9 and
        12.6% at 1, 3 and 5 years respectively (NSCLC: 43.8, 19.4, 13.1%; SCLC: 31.9,
        9.5, 9.5%). The mean interval first visit - treatment start was 2 months.
        The mean of direct costs per patient was 9000 €. The cost per life-year gained
        was 5200 € for NSCLC and 7600 € for SCLC patients.\r\nCONCLUSIONS The obtained
        results allow to describe the clinical characteristics of a wide cohort of
        patients diagnosed of lung cancer and their survival to 5 years. Globally,
        these results are similar to those who have been published in our country
        and others, and constitute a very thorough referent for assessing the impact
        of future therapeutic advances. The comparison among hospitals can also be
        the matter of further analysis for identifying the causes of the observed
        differences. Equally, specific strategies for some patients' subgroups could
        be designed in order to improve the cost-effectiveness of their treatment.

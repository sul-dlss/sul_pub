        expression of EphA5 is associated with Fuhrman nuclear grade and pathological
        tumour stage in ccRCC.</Title>\r\n    <Abstract>The incidence of renal cell
        carcinoma is increasing all over the world. The molecular mechanisms for tumorigenesis,
        progression and prognosis are still unknown. The erythropoietin-producing
        hepatoma amplified sequence (Eph) receptors have been reported to be expressed
        aberrantly in many types of human cancers and in particular EphA5 may play
        a role in certain human cancers. In this study, a set of clear cell renal
        cell carcinoma (ccRCC) tissues were subjected to immunohistochemistry. The
        relationship between EphA5 protein expression and clinicopathological parameters
        was statistically analysed. Our data show that EphA5 protein was negatively
        (0) or weakly (1+) expressed in 48 of 78 (61.5%), moderately (2+) expressed
        in 15 of 78 (19.2%) and strongly (3+) expressed in 15 of 78 (19.2%) tumour
        samples of ccRCC. Decreased expression of EphA5 was detected more often in
        females than in males (P = 0.017, r\r\n = -0.267). Expression of EphA5 was
        related negatively to Fuhrman grade (P = 0.013, r\r\n = -0.279) and pathological
        tumour stage pT (P = 0.003, r\r\n = -0.334). No relation between the expression
        of EphA5 and age of patients was found (P = 0.107, r\r\n = 0.184). Fuhrman
        grade and pT stage are the most important factors used in prognosis of ccRCC.
        Hence this study may provide a new and useful prognostic marker in the clinical
        practice of ccRCC.</Abstract>\r\n    <AuthorList>Wang,Xiaolin,|Xu,Haifei,|Wu,Zhijun,|Chen,Xiao,|Wang,Jiandong,</AuthorList>\r\n

        \   <Title>Clinico-pathological Study of Limb Salvage Surgery for Osteosarcoma:
        Experience in a Rural Cancer Center.</Title>\r\n    <Abstract>Although recent
        multimodality therapeutic protocols have led to improved survival in osteosarcoma
        (OS), the outcome still remains dismal. Ongoing international multicentric
        trials on OS aim to randomize patients for optimum management, based on histological
        response to NACT. The pathologic response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT)
        is the most important factor predicting prognosis. In this study of 23 cases
        of limb salvage surgery post neoadjuvant chemotherapy, mean age was 18.3 years,
        with male predominance. 65.5 % cases were conventional OS. Histologic assessment
        of chemotherapeutic effect done by Huvos grading revealed good response (Huvos
        lll and lV) in 15 (65.2 %) and poor response (Huvos l and ll) in eight (34.8 %).
        A scoring based on MRI with a scale of 1-6 was compared with histologic response.
        Five (62.5 %) of poor responders showed score of &gt;3 and 73.3 % of good
        responders showed =3. Dose intensity of NACT was calculated and correlated
        with the histological response. 53.3 % of good responders showed ARDI &gt; 0.9.
        Five (21.7 %) developed local recurrence and 10(43.4 %) had pulmonary metastasis.
        Adoption of more aggressive treatment modalities may ensure better histologic
        response and longer event free survival.</Abstract>\r\n    <AuthorList>Vijayanarasimha,Divya,|Nayanar,Sangeetha,K|Vikram,Syam,|Patil,Vijay,M|Babu,Satheesh,|Satheesan

        \   <Title>Hepatic perivascular epithelioid cell neoplasm: A clinical and
        pathological experience in diagnosis and treatment.</Title>\r\n    <Abstract>Hepatic
        perivascular epithelioid cell neoplasm (PEComa) is a rare type of neoplasm
        derived from mesenchymal tumors that is often misdiagnosed as hepatocellular
        carcinoma (HCC), hepatic hemangioma or other liver malignancies. The clinical
        and histological characteristics of PEComa have yet to be fully documented.
        To optimize the diagnosis and treatment of the disease, a retrospective analysis
        was performed to investigate the clinicopathological characteristics of 7
        patients diagnosed with hepatic PEComa in the Sun Yat-Sen Memorial Hospital
        between January 2004 and December 2015. Briefly, all the patients lacked specific
        symptoms, and a serological examination provided no further useful information.
        Additionally, non-specific imaging manifestations were observed. Microscopically,
        detection of epithelioid or spindle-shaped cells with adipocytes was suggestive
        of the disease, and an analysis of biomarkers, including the monoclonal antibody
        HMB-45, the melanocytic differentiation marker, Melan-A, and smooth muscle
        a-actin (SMA), helped to confirm the diagnosis. Regarding the treatment, 6
        patients (85.7%) received surgical resection procedures, and 1 patient (14.3%)
        was admitted for tumor arterial embolization and percutaneous microwave coagulation
        therapy. After a follow-up period of 12-20 months, no recurrence was observed.
        Taken together, hepatic PEComa should be suspended in patients with a liver
        tumor with asymptomatic manifestation and normal serological test results.
        In imaging studies, hepatic PEComa was able to mimic HCC, hepatic hemangioma
        and metastatic tumor, although the mass did not invade the adjacent organs
        and vessel. The definitive diagnosis was made on the basis of the typical
        morphological features and notable markers of the tumor tissue. It is recommended
        that patients with PEComa in a benign pattern deserve serial imaging follow-up,
        but surgery is indicated in patients suffering from large tumors (&gt;5 cm),
        or progressive enlargement or malignant tendency.</Abstract>\r\n    <AuthorList>Chen,Wenying,|Liu,Yeqing,|Zhuang,Yanyan,|Peng,Juanfei,|Huang,Fengting,|Zhang,Shineng,</AuthorList>\r\n

        of atlantoaxial dislocation prevented by pathological position of the transverse
        ligament in fixed, irreducible os odontoideum: operative illustrations and
        radiographic correlates in 41 patients.</Title>\r\n    <Abstract>OBJECTIVE
        Os odontoideum (OO) is a craniovertebral junction (CVJ) abnormality in which
        an ossicle (small bone) is cranial to a hypoplastic dens by a variable gap.
        This abnormality can result in instability, which may be reducible or irreducible.
        What leads to irreducibility in OO is unclear. Therefore, the authors sought
        to better understand the causes of irreducibility in OO. METHODS A retrospective
        review was conducted, which identified more than 200 patients who had undergone
        surgical treatment for OO between 1978 and 2015 at the University of Iowa
        Hospitals and Clinics. Only the 41 patients who had irreducible OO were included
        in this study. All inpatient and outpatient records were retrospectively reviewed,
        and patient demographics, clinical presentation, radiographic findings, surgical
        treatment, and operative findings were recorded and analyzed. RESULTS The
        cohort of 41 patients who were found to have irreducible OO included both
        children and adults. A majority of patients were adults (61% were 18 years
        or older). Clinical presentation included neck pain and headache in the majority
        of patients (93%). Weakness, sensory disturbances, and myelopathy were invariably
        present in all 41 patients (100%). Down syndrome was much more common in the
        pediatric cohort than in the adult cohort; of the 16 pediatric patients, 6
        had Down syndrome (38%), and none of the adults did. Of the 16 pediatric patients,
        5 had segmentation failure (31%) in the subaxial spine, and none of the adults
        did. A form of atlantoaxial dislocation was seen in all cases. On CT imaging,
        atlantoaxial facets were dislocated in all 41 cases but did not have osseous
        changes that would have prevented reduction. On MRI, the transverse ligament
        was identified anterior and inferior to the ossicle and superior to the hypoplastic
        odontoid process in all cases in which these studies were available (i.e.,
        post-MRI era; 36 of 36 cases). The ligament was hypointense on T2-weighted
        images but also had an associated hyperintense signal on T2 images. Intraoperatively,
        the transverse ligament was identified anterior and inferior to the ossicle
        and superior to the hypoplastic odontoid process in all 41 cases. CONCLUSIONS
        In the largest series to date of irreducible OO and the only study to examine
        variable factors that lead to irreducibility in OO, the authors found that
        the position of the transverse ligament anterior and inferior to the ossicle
        is the most common factor in the irreducibility of OO. The presence of granulation
        tissue and of the dystopic variant of OO is also associated with irreducibility.
        The presence of Down syndrome and segmentation failure probably leads to faster
        progression of ligamentous incompetence and therefore earlier presentation
        of instability and irreducibility. This is the first study in which intraoperative

        growth factor receptor mutations should be considered as a prognostic factor
        for survival of patients with pathological fractures or painful bone metastases
        from non-small cell lung cancer.</Title>\r\n    <Abstract>AIMS This study
        aims to assess first, whether mutations in the epidermal growth factor receptor
        (EGFR) and Kirsten rat sarcoma (kRAS) genes are associated with overall survival
        (OS) in patients who present with symptomatic bone metastases from non-small
        cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and secondly, whether mutation status should be incorporated
        into prognostic models that are used when deciding on the appropriate palliative
        treatment for symptomatic bone metastases.\r\nPATIENTS AND METHODS We studied
        139 patients with NSCLC treated between 2007 and 2014 for symptomatic bone
        metastases and whose mutation status was known. The association between mutation
        status and overall survival was analysed and the results applied to a recently
        published prognostic model to determine whether including the mutation status
        would improve its discriminatory power.\r\nRESULTS The median OS was 3.9 months
        (95% confidence interval (CI) 2.1 to 5.7). Patients with EGFR (15%) or kRAS
        mutations (34%) had a median OS of 17.3 months (95% CI 12.7 to 22.0) and 1.8
        months (95% CI 1.0 to 2.7), respectively. Compared with EGFR-positive patients,
        EGFR-negative patients had a 2.5 times higher risk of death (95% CI 1.5 to
        4.2). Incorporating EGFR mutation status in the prognostic model improved
        its discriminatory power.\r\nCONCLUSION Survival prediction models for patients
        with symptomatic bone metastases are used to determine the most appropriate
        (surgical) treatment for painful or fractured lesions. This study shows that
        NSCLC should not be regarded as a single entity in such models. Cite this

        \   <Title>Pathological findings of uterine tumors preoperatively diagnosed
        as red degeneration of leiomyoma by MRI.</Title>\r\n    <Abstract>PURPOSE
        Venous infarction of a leiomyoma is known as red degeneration of leiomyoma
        (RDL) and can be a cause of acute abdomen. Although magnetic resonance imaging
        (MRI) is the only modality that can depict the inner condition of a leiomyoma,
        the typical MR findings of RDL are sometimes identified incidentally even
        in asymptomatic patients. The purpose of this study is to clarify common pathological
        findings of uterine tumors preoperatively diagnosed as RDL by MRI.\r\nMETHODS
        We diagnosed 28 cases of RDL by MRI from March 2007 to April 2015. The ten
        lesions subjected to pathological analysis after resection were included in
        the study and reviewed by a gynecological pathologist. The average time from
        MRI to operation was 4.7 months.\r\nRESULTS The typical beefy-red color was
        not observed on the cut surface of the tumor except in one tumor resected
        during the acute phase. All lesions diagnosed as RDL by MRI had common pathological
        findings consistent with red degeneration of leiomyoma, including coagulative
        necrosis. Other common pathological features of RDL besides extensive coagulative
        necrosis appear to be a lack of inflammatory cell infiltrate or hemorrhage
        in the entire lesion.\r\nCONCLUSIONS Although RDL is known to cause acute
        abdomen, its typical MR findings can be observed even in asymptomatic patients
        in a condition that manifests long after red degeneration. The characteristic
        pathological findings in both the acute phase and the chronic phase that we
        found in this study, along with radiology reports, will be helpful references
        for gynecologists and pathologists in suspecting a history of red degeneration
        and confirming the diagnosis.</Abstract>\r\n    <AuthorList>Nakai,Go,|Yamada,Takashi,|Hamada,Takamitsu,|Atsukawa,Natsuko,|Tanaka,Yoshikazu,|Yamamoto,Kiyohito,|Higashiyama,Akira,|Juri,Hiroshi,|Nakamoto,Atsushi,|Yamamoto,Kazuhiro,|Hirose,Yoshinobu,|Ohmichi,Masahide,|Narumi,Yoshifumi,</AuthorList>\r\n

        of pathological phenotype of hypertrophic scar fibroblasts via co-culture
        with adipose derived stem cells.</Title>\r\n    <Abstract>Hypertrophic scar
        (HS) is a dermal fibroproliferative disease characterized by fibroblast over-proliferation,
        overproduction and deposition of the extracellular matrix (ECM). Growing evidence
        demonstrated that adipose derived stem cells (ASCs) secrete a plethora of
        trophic and anti-fibrotic factors, which suppress inflammation and ameliorate
        fibrosis of different tissues. However, few studies investigate their effect
        on repressing HS activity. This study evaluated the suppressing effect of
        ASCs on HS fibroblast bioactivity and the possible mechanism via a co-culture
        model. HS-derived fibroblasts (HSFs) and ASCs were isolated from individual
        patients. HSFs or HSFs treated with transforming growth factor-ß1 (TGF-ß1)
        were co-cultured with ASCs and the change of HSF cellular behaviors, such
        as cell proliferation, migration, contractility and gene/protein expression
        of scar-related molecules, were evaluated by cell counting assay, cell cycle
        analysis, scratch wound assay, fibroblast-populated collagen lattice (FPCL)
        contractility assay, real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR),
        ELISA, and western blotting assay. After 5 days of ASC co-culture treatment,
        the expression levels of collagen I (Col 1), collagen III (Col 3), fibronectin
        (FN), TGF-ß1, interleukin-6 (IL-6), interleukin-8(IL-8), connective tissue
        growth factor (CTGF) and alpha-smooth muscle actin (a-SMA) in HSFs decreased
        significantly while the expression levels of decorin (DCN) and MMP1/TIMP1
        ration increased significantly. Besides, after 5 days of exogenous TGF-ß1
        stimulation, the expression levels of collagen 1, fibronectin, TGF-ß1, IL-6,
        CTGF and a-SMA in HSFs increased significantly. Impressively, all these increased
        gene expression levels were reversed by 5 days of ASCs co-culture treatment.
        Additionally, the proliferation, migration and contractility of HSFs were
        all significantly reduced by ASC co-culture treatment. Furthermore, the protein
        levels of TGF-ß1 and intracellular signal pathway related molecules,such as
        p-smad2, p-smad3, p-Stat3 and p-ERK, were down-regulated significantly in
        HSFs after 5 days of ASCs co-culture treatment.This study demonstrated that
        co-culture of HSFs with ASCs not only inhibited proliferation, migration and
        contractility of HSFs but also decreased the expression levels of HSF-related
        or TGF-ß1-induced molecules. Additionally, the anti-fibrotic effect on HSFs
        was likely mediated by the inhibition of multiple intracellular signaling.
        The results of this study suggest the therapeutic potential of ASCs for HS
        treatment, which is worth of further investigation.</Abstract>\r\n    <AuthorList>Deng,Jingcheng,|Shi,Yuan,|Gao,Zhen,|Zhang,Wen,Jie|Wu,Xiaoli,|Cao,Weigang,|Liu,Wei,</AuthorList>\r\n

        features and outcomes of progression of CLL on the BCL2 inhibitor venetoclax.</Title>\r\n
        \   <Abstract>The BCL2 inhibitor venetoclax achieves responses in ~79% of
        patients with relapsed or refractory chronic lymphocytic leukemia/small lymphocytic
        lymphoma (RR-CLL/SLL), irrespective of risk factors associated with poor response
        to chemo-immunotherapy. A limitation of this targeted therapy is progressive
        disease (PD) in some patients. To define the risk factors for progression,
        the clinico-pathological features of PD and the outcomes for patients after
        venetoclax failure, we analyzed 67 heavily pre-treated patients on three early
        phase clinical trials. Investigations at progression included PET scan and
        biopsy. Twenty-five (37%) patients manifested PD on therapy: 17 with Richter
        transformation (RT) and eight with progressive CLL/SLL. RT occurred significantly
        earlier (median 7.9 months) than progressive CLL (median 23.4 months) (p =
        0.003). Among patients who received the recommended phase II dose of venetoclax
        or higher (=400mg/day), fludarabine-refractoriness and complex karyotype were
        associated with progression (hazard ratio 7.01 (95%CI 1.7 - 28.5); p=0.002
        and 6.6 [1.5 - 29.8]; p = 0.005, respectively); while del(17p) and/or \r\n
        mutation were not (p=0.75). Median post-progression survival was 13 (&lt;1
        - 49.9) months. BTK inhibitors were active in progressive CLL, but outcomes
        were mixed. Patients with disease that is fludarabine-refractory or has complex
        cytogenetics should have occult RT excluded before initiating venetoclax therapy.</Abstract>\r\n

        \   <Title>Clear Cell Carcinoma of the Uterine Cervix: A Clinical and Pathological
        Analysis of 47 Patients Without Intrauterine Diethylstilbestrol Exposure.</Title>\r\n
        \   <Abstract>OBJECTIVES The aim of this study was to summarize the clinical
        and pathological characteristics and to conduct prognosis analysis of patients
        who were diagnosed with clear cell carcinoma of the uterine cervix (CCCUC)
        and without a history of exposure to diethylstilbestrol.\r\nMETHODS We performed
        a retrospective review of all the patients with CCCUC who were diagnosed and
        treated at Zhejiang Cancer Hospital between 1998 and 2014. Charts were reviewed
        for clinical and pathological characteristics, and prognosis analysis was
        conducted.\r\nRESULTS A total of 47 patients were included. Median age was
        52 years. No patient had a history of exposure to diethylstilbestrol. The
        International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics stage distribution was
        55.3% (n = 26) stage I, 40.4% (n = 19) stage II, 2.1% (n = 1) stage III, and
        2.1% (n = 1) stage IV. Forty-two patients (89.4%) underwent radical hysterectomy
        and pelvic lymphadenectomy. Pathological examination revealed deep cervical
        stromal invasion (greater than two thirds) in 20 patients (48.4%), pelvic
        lymph node (PLN) metastasis in 10 patients (23.8%), lymphovascular space involvement
        in 9 patients (21.4%), and ovarian metastasis in 1 patient (2.4%). Advanced
        tumor stage (IIB-IV), larger tumor size (&gt;4 cm), and PLN metastasis had
        negative effects on progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS)
        (P &lt; 0.05). Adjuvant radiation therapy alone or concurrent chemoradiation
        therapy after radical surgery did not affect PFS or OS in patients with risk
        factors (P &gt; 0.05).\r\nCONCLUSIONS International Federation of Gynecology
        and Obstetrics stage, tumor size, and PLN status were prognostic factors for
        both PFS and OS in patients with CCCUC. The long-term effects of adjuvant
        radiation therapy or concurrent chemoradiation therapy may be limited for
        CCCUC patients with risk factors. Future larger case series or clinical trials
        are required to confirm these findings.</Abstract>\r\n    <AuthorList>Yang,Li,|Zheng,Aiwen,|Zhang,Xiang,|Fang,Xianhua,|Sun,Wenyong,|Chen,Yaqing,</AuthorList>\r\n

        \   <Title>Chronicles of a reductase: Biochemistry, genetics and physio-pathological
        role of GSNOR.</Title>\r\n    <Abstract>S-nitrosylation is a major redox posttranslational
        modification involved in cell signaling. The steady state concentration of
        S-nitrosylated proteins depends on the balance between the relative ability
        to generate nitric oxide (NO) via NO synthase and to reduce nitrosothiols
        by denitrosylases. Numerous works have been published in last decades regarding
        the role of NO and S-nitrosylation in the regulation of protein structure
        and function, and in driving cellular activities in vertebrates. Notwithstanding
        an increasing number of observations indicates that impairment of denitrosylation
        equally affects cellular homeostasis, there is still no report providing comprehensive
        knowledge on the impact that denitrosylation has on maintaining correct physiological
        processes and organ activities. Among denitrosylases, S-nitrosoglutathione
        reductase (GSNOR) represents the prototype enzyme to disclose how denitrosylation
        plays a crucial role in tuning NO-bioactivity and how much it deeply impacts
        on cell homeostasis and human patho-physiology. In this review we attempt
        to illustrate the history of GSNOR discovery and provide the evidence so far
        reported in support of GSNOR implications in development and human disease.</Abstract>\r\n

        \   <Title>Multiple long bone cysts revealed by MRI in trichorhinophalangeal
        syndrome type II predisposing to pathological fractures.</Title>\r\n    <Abstract>Trichorhinophalangeal
        syndrome type II is a rare genetic disorder with the few published case reports
        mainly reporting the radiographic skeletal manifestations. There are no published
        imaging reports of long bone cysts involving multiple bones in this condition.
        We report a unique case of bone cysts involving multiple long bones detected
        with MRI in a patient with trichorhinophalangeal syndrome type II complicated
        by a subsequent pathological fracture. It is possible that the bone cysts
        are a previously undescribed feature of this syndrome; however, the evidence
        is insufficient to establish a definite association. Chromosomal abnormality
        identified in this patient is consistent with trichorhinophalangeal syndrome
        type II with no unusual features. Although the nature of these bone cysts
        is unclear, they are one of the causes of the known increased fracture risk
        observed in this syndrome.</Abstract>\r\n    <AuthorList>Konala,Praveen,|Kiely,Nigel,|Noakes,Charlotte,|Blair,Edward,|Cassar-Pullicino,Victor,N</AuthorList>\r\n

        \   <Title>[Pathological Complete Response of Metastatic Testicular Tumor
        with Persistent Low Level Positive Human Chorionic Gonadotropin after Chemotherapy].</Title>\r\n
        \   <Abstract>We describe a case of testicular tumor with multiple metastasis
        to the lung,retoroperitoneal lymph node, and brain. After chemotherapy the
        retroperitoneal lymph node and brain metastasis disappeared,but the multiple
        pulmonary metastases but not disappear,although they were reduced in size.
        Since the human chorionic gonadotoropin (HCG) was persistently dected at a
        low level,we performed a testosterone tolerance test. The HCG level became
        undetectable for a while,but was detected at a low level again. Then the patient
        underwent residual tumor removal of some of the residual pulmonary disease,which
        was diagnosed as tumor necrosis. The patient has been followed on an ambulatory
        basis after surgery for 12 months without recurrence. In this case a definitive
        diagnosis was difficult,because of the low positive level of HCG.</Abstract>\r\n

        \   <Title>Clinico-Pathological Patterns of Patients Who Underwent Orbital
        Exenteration in a Tertiary Eye Hospital of Nepal.</Title>\r\n    <Abstract>BACKGROUND
        Orbital exenteration is a destructive procedure performed by removing all
        or part of the orbital contents along with entire eyeball. It is a procedure
        reserved for life threatening malignancies and some nonmalignant disorders
        which are not controlled by conservative management.\r\nMETHODS This is a
        retrospective study done on patients who underwent orbital exenteration at
        Tilganga Institute of Ophthalmology from1 January 2006- 30 in December 2014.\r\nRESULTS
        The mean age of patients was 30 years (range 1-78), with male preponderance
        of 15(55.6%. Overall presenting duration of eye morbidity was 18 months (2
        months-8.5 years). The most common presenting complaint was protrusion of
        eyeball1, 4(50%), primary site of tumor being intraocular in 10 patients (35.7%,)
        and total orbital exenteration was the most commonly performed type of surgery
        in 16(57.1%) out of 27 patients. The most common etiology responsible for
        orbital exenteration, in pediatric age group of 9/27 patients (64.2%), was
        retinoblastoma whereas conjunctival squamous cell carcinoma (SCC)accounts
        for 5 patients (38.4%) in adults. Overall, the most common cause of orbital
        exenteration was retinoblastoma 9(32.1%).\r\nCONCLUSION The most common etiologies
        requiring orbital exenteration were retinoblastoma (in children and overall)
        and conjunctival squamous cell carcinoma (in adults), both diseases that could
        be addressed with less invasive treatment modality if detected earlier in
        the disease process. Designing strategy is important for early detection and
        treatment of these conditions, which would decrease disease morbidity and
        prognosis, potentially sparing sight and life.</Abstract>\r\n    <AuthorList>Ben,Limbu,|Aemero,Mengesha,|Gushchin,Anya,G|Moore,Grant,H|Rohit,Saiju,</AuthorList>\r\n

        \   <Title>Infantile myofibromatosis - a clinical and pathological diagnostic
        challenge.</Title>\r\n    <Abstract>Infantile myofibromatosis is a rare disorder
        of fibroblastic/myofibroblastic proliferation and represents the most frequent
        type of mesenchymal tumor in the neonatal period and primary infancy.Three
        clinical types have been described: solitary, multicentric, and generalized
        (with visceral involvement). A correct characterization of the histopathology
        is essential to diagnose these neoplasias in early infancy. We present a case
        of multicentric infantile myofibromatosis with regression over time.</Abstract>\r\n

        \   <Title>In-depth clinico-pathological examination of RNA foci in a large
        cohort of C9ORF72 expansion carriers.</Title>\r\n    <Abstract>A growing body
        of evidence suggests that a loss of chromosome 9 open reading frame 72 (C9ORF72)
        expression, formation of dipeptide-repeat proteins, and generation of RNA
        foci contribute to disease pathogenesis in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and
        frontotemporal dementia. Although the levels of C9ORF72 transcripts and dipeptide-repeat
        proteins have already been examined thoroughly, much remains unknown about
        the role of RNA foci in C9ORF72-linked diseases. As such, we performed a comprehensive
        RNA foci study in an extensive pathological cohort of C9ORF72 expansion carriers
        (n = 63). We evaluated two brain regions using a newly developed computer-automated
        pipeline allowing recognition of cell nuclei and RNA foci (sense and antisense)
        supplemented by manual counting. In the frontal cortex, the percentage of
        cells with sense or antisense RNA foci was 26 or 12%, respectively. In the
        cerebellum, 23% of granule cells contained sense RNA foci and 1% antisense
        RNA foci. Interestingly, the highest percentage of cells with RNA foci was
        observed in cerebellar Purkinje cells (~70%). In general, more cells contained
        sense RNA foci than antisense RNA foci; however, when antisense RNA foci were
        present, they were usually more abundant. We also observed that an increase
        in the percentage of cells with antisense RNA foci was associated with a delayed
        age at onset in the frontal cortex (r = 0.43, p = 0.003), whereas no other
        associations with clinico-pathological features were seen. Importantly, our
        large-scale study is the first to provide conclusive evidence that RNA foci
        are not the determining factor of the clinico-pathological variability observed
        in C9ORF72 expansion carriers and it emphasizes that the distribution of RNA
        foci does not follow the pattern of neurodegeneration, stressing the complex
        interplay between different aspects of C9ORF72-related diseases.</Abstract>\r\n

        \   <Title>Radiological and pathological evaluation of the level of arterial
        division after colon cancer surgery.</Title>\r\n    <Abstract>AIM In aiming
        to cure patients with colorectal cancer surgery, the surgeon must carefully
        dissect the mesocolon and mesorectum and divide the vascular pedicle as near
        to its origin so as to include all local lymph nodes. This has been termed
        Complete Mesocolic Excision (CME). The distance from distal vascular tie to
        the bowel wall in the fixed specimen is an indication as to the quality of
        surgery but this does not assess the length of the residual vascular pedicle
        and by implication, residual lymph nodes.. The aim of this study was to establish
        if our surgeons were carrying out CME by assessing the length of the proximal
        arterial pedicle and relating this to arterial length in the fixed specimen.\r\nMETHOD
        This was a single centre prospective study of patients undergoing elective
        surgery for locally advanced colorectal cancer. An abdominal and pelvic CT
        scan was performed two days postoperatively and a radiologist blinded to the
        operative procedure, measured the length of the residual arterial stump. Similarly,
        the length of the vessel in the fixed resected specimen and lymph node yield
        was also recorded..\r\nRESULTS 52 patients were recruited. The mean length
        of the residual arterial stump was 38 mm (95% CI 33 - 43), which was significantly
        longer than &lt;10 mm recommended in guidelines (p&lt;0.0001). The mean length
        was 31 (95% CI 25 - 37), mm (and 49 (95% CI 40 - 57), mm for left and right
        sided resections respectively. There was no correlation between the residual
        arterial stump and the pathology.\r\nCONCLUSIONS The residual arterial length
        was greater than suggested by guidelines and may indicate that our surgery
        is less radical than we planned. Caution should be taken when using pathological
        measurements of vascular ligation as it may not reflect the height of the
        pedicle division. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.</Abstract>\r\n

        \   <Title>Pavlik harness treatment for pathological developmental dysplasia
        of the hip: meeting the standard?</Title>\r\n    <Abstract>In the UK, the
        Pavlik harness is generally the accepted treatment technique for the treatment
        of neonatal and infant pathological developmental dysplasia of the hip. In
        2013, the success rate of the Pavlik harness became an outcome measure from
        the British Society of Children's Orthopaedic Surgery for appraisal and revalidation
        with the GMC for paediatric orthopaedic surgery. The standard set requires
        an 80% success rate, with less than 20% requiring surgery. This study evaluated
        the outcomes of Pavlik harness treatment in neonates/infants with 'pathological
        hips' diagnosed by ultrasound imaging in a district general hospital setting.
        In a 10-year prospective observational longitudinal cohort study, modified
        Graf type III and IV hips (excluding those presenting with irreducible hip
        dislocation) were classified as pathological and splinted. A total of 2826
        neonates/infants underwent ultrasound assessment in the paediatric orthopaedic
        'screening clinic'. Neonates and infants were referred as 'at-risk' or as
        clinically unstable by the Paediatric Department and by general practitioners.
        Thirty-one Graf type III and 95 Graf type IV hips were identified and treated
        with a Pavlik harness. One Graf type III (30/31=success rate 96.8%) and three
        clinically unstable Graf type IV hips progressed to irreducible hip dislocations
        (92/95=96.8%). The success rate of the Pavlik harness in Graf type III and
        IV dysplasia was 96.8%, with 3.2% requiring surgery because of progression
        of the condition, confirming acceptable results for this technique in a district
        general hospital setting.</Abstract>\r\n    <AuthorList>Choudry,Qaisar,|Paton,Robin,W</AuthorList>\r\n

        \   <Title>A case of advanced gastric cancer achieved a pathological complete
        response by chemotherapy.</Title>\r\n    <Abstract>BACKGROUND Although chemotherapy
        is the first recommended treatment of unresectable gastric cancer, a pathological
        complete response is a rare event.\r\nCASE PRESENTATION A 58-year-old male
        was diagnosed as gastric cancer with a bulky tumor, lymphadenopathy, and suspicious
        peritoneal dissemination. The patient underwent chemotherapy with S-1 and
        cisplatin. After three courses of chemotherapy, a computed tomography showed
        dramatic improvements in gastric wall thickening, shrinkage of lymphadenopathy,
        and disappearance of disseminated peritoneal lesion. The patient underwent
        potentially curative resection by total gastrectomy with D2 lymph node dissection.
        Histological examination revealed the absence of malignant cells not only
        in the resected specimen but also in the harvested lymph nodes. At present,
        more than 7 years after the initial surgery, the patient is still alive without
        any recurrence.\r\nCONCLUSIONS We obtained a pathological complete response
        by chemotherapy with S-1 and cisplatin for advanced gastric cancer. Although
        a pathological complete response is a rare event, it would be associated with
        the long-term survival of patients with advanced gastric cancer.</Abstract>\r\n

        \   <Title>Nature of Hard Tissues in Oral Pathological Lesions -Using Modified
        Gallego's Stain.</Title>\r\n    <Abstract>INTRODUCTION Histological stains
        are dyes that bind to various tissues. Special stains form an integral part
        of routine histopathology as an adjunct to Haematoxylin and Eosin (H&amp;E),
        and give meaningful diagnostic information of the tissues available. By using
        routine histological procedure like H&amp;E alone, it is difficult to differentiate
        the various hard tissues present in the oral pathological lesions. Modified
        Gallego's stain can be used as one of the differential stain for these hard
        tissues.\r\nAIM To differentiate various hard tissues of teeth and to identify
        the presence of hard tissue components in different oral pathological lesions
        using Modified Gallego's stain under light microscope.\r\nMATERIALS AND METHODS
        A total sample of 20 cases, amongst which 10 were human extracted teeth and
        10 oral pathological lesions were included. From 10 human extracted teeth,
        five ground sections and five decalcified sections were prepared. From pathological
        lesions, two slides of each lesion were prepared. All the sections were stained
        with Modified Gallego's stain and viewed under light microscopy.\r\nRESULTS
        In properly stained slides, cementum stained red, dentin and bone stained
        green and enamel stained pink in colour.\r\nCONCLUSION Modified Gallego's
        stain can be used as a differential stain for various hard tissues in oral
        pathological lesions and also for ground sections for which histochemical
        stains are very rare.</Abstract>\r\n    <AuthorList>Mudhiraj,Panthala,Veenila|Vanje,Manjushri,Madhukar|Reddy,Bachamgari,Narender|Ahmed,Syed,Afroz|Suri,Charu,|Taveer,Shahela,|Kumar,Shravan,</AuthorList>\r\n

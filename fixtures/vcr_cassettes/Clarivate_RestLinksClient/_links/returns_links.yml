        and other predictors of type 2 diabetes disproportionally affect Hispanic
        and Black children in the US compared to non-Hispanic White (NHW) children.
        Yet, the prevalence of prediabetes in children remains unestablished, and
        guidelines for screening young children are lacking. This study examined the
        relationships between demographic factors and prediabetes in vulnerable youth
        in central Texas.Subjects/methodsThis is a cross-sectional analysis of baseline
        data from 976 3rd-5th graders (7-12 years) who participated in TX Sprouts,
        a school-based gardening, nutrition, and cooking trial in 16 elementary schools
        serving mainly children from minority backgrounds and lower-income households.
        Measures collected included age, sex, ethnicity, free/reduced-priced school
        lunch (FRL) status, parent educational attainment (questionnaires), BMI from
        height (stadiometer) and weight (TANITA scale), and prediabetes status from
        fasting plasma glucose (FPG) and HbA1c. Regressions examined cross-sectional
        associations between demographics and FPG, HbA1c, and prediabetes.ResultsChildren
        were 47% male, 67% Hispanic, and 10% Black, with a mean age of 9.3 years;
        71% received FRL, 50% had overweight/obesity, and 26% had prediabetes. Prediabetes
        rates were 2.8 and 4.8 times higher in Hispanic and Black children compared
        to NHW children, respectively (p & LE; 0.001), and 1.5 times higher in children
        with obesity versus normal BMI (p = 0.02). Children of parents with only an
        8th-grade education, some high school education, or a high school degree had
        3.1, 2.7, and 2.2 times higher odds of having prediabetes compared to children
        of college graduates, respectively (p & LE; 0.004). Analyses with FPG and
        HbA1c yielded similar results.ConclusionThese findings suggest a potential
        need for earlier screening, more comprehensive testing guidelines, and prevention
        programs tailored toward minority children, children with obesity, and children
        of parents with low educational attainment. Future research should explore
        this finding in a larger, nationally representative sample.","count":1}}},"fund_ack":{"grants":{"count":1,"grant":{"grant_agency_names":{"pref":"N","content":"We

        stable isotopic composition of dissolved nitrous oxide (N2O) is a tracer for
        the production, transport, and consumption of this greenhouse gas in the ocean.
        Here we present dissolved N2O concentration and isotope data from the South
        Atlantic Ocean, spanning from the western side of the mid-Atlantic Ridge to
        the upwelling zone off the southern African coast. In the eastern South Atlantic,
        shallow N2O production by nitrifier denitrification contributed a flux of
        isotopically depleted N2O to the atmosphere. Along the African coast, N2O
        fluxes to the atmosphere of up to 46 mu mol/m(2)/d were calculated using satellite-derived
        QuikSCAT wind speed data, while fluxes at the offshore stations averaged 0.04
        mu mol/m(2)/d. Comparison of the isotopic composition of the deeper N2O in
        the South Atlantic (800m to 1000m) to measurements made in other regions suggests
        that water advected from one or more of the major oxygen deficient zones contributed
        N2O to the mesopelagic South Atlantic via the Southern Ocean. This deeper
        N2O was isotopically and isotopomerically enriched (N-15(bulk) - N2O = 8.70.1,
        O-18 - N2O = 46.50.2, and Site Preference = 18.7 +/- 0.6 parts per thousand)
        relative to the shallow N2O source, indicating that N2O consumption by denitrification
        influenced its isotopic composition. The N2O concentration maximum was observed
        between 200m and 400m and reached 49 nM near the Angolan coast. The depths
        of the N2O concentration maximum coincided with those of sedimentary particle
        resuspension along the coast. The isotopic composition of this N2O (N-15(bulk)
        - N2O = 5.8 +/- 0.1 parts per thousand, O-18 - N2O = 39.7 +/- 0.1 parts per
        thousand, and Site Preference = 9.8 +/- 1.0 parts per thousand) was consistent
        with production by diffusion-limited nitrate (NO3-) reduction to nitrite (NO2-),
        followed by NO2- reduction to N2O by denitrification and/or nitrifier denitrification,
        with additional N2O production by NH2OH decomposition during NH3 oxidation.
        The sediment surface, benthic boundary layer, or particles resuspended from
        the sediments are likely to have provided the physical and chemical conditions
        necessary to produce this N2O.","count":1}}},"fund_ack":{"grants":{"count":2,"grant":[{"grant_agency_names":[{"pref":"Y","content":"National

        characterization through estimation of the noise power spectrum (NPS) is a
        central component of the evaluation of digital x-ray systems. We begin with
        a brief review of the fundamentals of NPS theory and measurement, derive explicit
        expressions for calculation of the one- and two-dimensional (1D and 2D) NPS,
        and discuss some of the considerations and tradeoffs when these concepts are
        applied to digital systems. Measurements of the NPS of two detectors for digital
        mammography are presented to illustrate some of the implications of the choices
        available. For both systems, two-dimensional noise power spectra obtained
        over a range of input fluence exhibit pronounced asymmetry between the orthogonal
        frequency dimensions. The 2D spectra of both systems also demonstrate dominant
        structures both on and off the primary frequency axes indicative of periodic
        noise components. Although the two systems share many common noise characteristics,
        there are significant differences, including markedly different dark-noise
        magnitudes, differences in NPS shape as a function of both spatial frequency
        and exposure, and differences in the natures of the residual fixed pattern
        noise following flat fielding corrections. For low x-ray exposures, quantum
        noise-limited operation may be possible only at low spatial frequency. Depending
        on the method of obtaining the 1D NPS (i.e., synthetic slit scanning or slice
        extraction from the 2D NPS), on-axis periodic structures can be misleadingly
        smoothed or missed entirely. Our measurements indicate that for these systems,
        1D spectra useful for the purpose of detective quantum efficiency calculation
        may be obtained from thin cuts through the central portion of the calculated
        2D NPS. On the other hand, low-frequency spectral;values do not converge to
        an asymptotic value with increasing slit length when 1D spectra are generated
        using the scanned synthetic slit method. Aliasing can contribute significantly
        to the digital NPS, especially near the Nyquist frequency. Calculation of
        the theoretical presampling NPS and explicit inclusion of aliased noise power
        shows good agreement with measured values. (C) 1999 American Association of

=============
Note:

Which of the following hash fields are actually used by CAP ? Also what did our provider do with them ? Is there a way to get them in the new API ?

:documenttypes_sw     /  DocumentTypeList
:documentcategory_sw  /  DocumentCategory
:type
     sul_document_type = lookup_cap_doc_type_by_sw_doc_category(record_as_hash[:documentcategory_sw])
     record_as_hash[:type] = sul_document_type

! Important !

1/
:documentcategory_sw/DocumentCategory has 3 possibles values: (a) Conference Proceeding Document (b) Journal Document (c) Other
When applying the function lookup_cap_doc_type_by_sw_doc_category we get
- "inProcedding" for (a)
- article for everything else

2/
As of now the new Web of Science API returns:
(i)  <doctype>[2]<doctype>Proceeding Paper</doctype> in lieu of (a)
(ii) <doctype><doctype> Anything <doctype> in lieu of (b) or (c)

In fact what is happening now is that (i) is added as a second  <doctype> to precise that it is indeed a proceeding. For everything else i.e. (a) and (b), those categories
simply disapear, we only get the value that was used by :documenttypes_sw. Indeed if checked above you will see :documenttypes_sw     ==>       static_data->summary->doctypes->doctype

=============
Not available anymore
1 - Does cap use any of these information
2 - Is there still a way to obtain these information from our provider such as trough the LINKS ARM API
